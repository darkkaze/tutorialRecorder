## Third-Party License Notice

This software uses PyQt6, which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3).

**Why this matters:**
I prefer the Beerware License because it's simple and fun, but PyQt6's GPL v3 license technically requires derivative works to also be GPL v3.

**My stance:**
This project is free, open-source, and distributed with full source code. While I'm keeping the Beerware License because I love Beer 🍺, I acknowledge that PyQt6's GPL v3 license may impose additional requirements if you redistribute or modify this software commercially.

**For users:**
- Use this software freely for any purpose
- If you plan commercial redistribution, be aware of PyQt6's GPL v3 requirements
- Or just buy me a beer and we're cool 🍺
